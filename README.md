We also provide two code samples of TAC applications:

- [nucypher/tdec-sandbox](https://github.com/nucypher/tdec-sandbox)
- [nucypher/tdec-nft-example](https://github.com/nucypher/tdec-nft-example)

These examples showcase integration with React-based web application and an end-to-end flow of creating conditioned encryption, and encrypting & decrypting data.
